# React Express Template

Basic template for React in Express with Heroku support.
Works in development and production mode.
Able to use any Express methods, such as `app.get` in React using `fetch`.

# How to use

Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.

This has been tested in Windows 10 with PowerShell, but it should work for other systems and command interfaces.

If you run into any problems, create a new issue for this repo and I will try to help.

## Installation

```powershell
# Clone repository into ./react-express-template folder
git clone https://github.com/darccyy/react-express-template.git

# Install dependencies
npm run install
```

## Development

Runs 2 server programs (Using `concurrently`):

- Client with React
- Server with Express & Nodemon

Corresponding server soft restarts when file is saved.

```powershell
# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Concurrently

The module concurrently, used only for the development environment, might require global installation with this command:

```powershell
npm install concurrently -g
```

If faced with an error when running, try in Command Prompt with the `cmd` command.

## Production

```powershell
# Build production (Also reinstalls modules)
npm run build

# Start production server
npm run start
```
